# WhatToDoToday

## Utilized: ReactJS, CSS, and JavaScript

### This application allows you to get recommendations for what to do today in a Canadian city based on the weather.

### I utilize 2 API calls to open-meteo.com, first one to get the coordinates of a city, and the second to recieve the weather data for that day.

### I then make an OpenAI API call to a chatgpt model to ask for 5 recommendations on what to do today based on the weather data.
